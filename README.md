# LO14_projects
In this repo, you will find a school project where we had to create a BASH script in order to synchronize two folders of file, we had to verify if the files already existed in the other folder and if it existed and the date was different we had to choose the most recent one and keep it for synchronization

This project was made by LucasJeanpierre and myself
